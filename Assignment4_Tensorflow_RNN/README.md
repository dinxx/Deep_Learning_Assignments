# Assignment 4 - Cloth Classification Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM/GRU)

## Task

## Data
The data is the same as Assignment 2. Again, it is to be stored in a folder with path "../data_Ass23" with respect to the directory in which the file train.py is located. Please do not extract the data, since the dataloader.py module does exactly that.

Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:
0 T-shirt/top	1 Trouser	2 Pullover	3 Dress		4 Coat
5 Sandal	6 Shirt		7 Sneaker	8 Bag		9 Ankle boot
